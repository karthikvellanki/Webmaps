# Webmaps
- This is a webmap that is built with Python and folium.
- The map has multiple layers that can be turned on and off using the layer control panel:
   - The first layer displays the location and elevation of volcanoes
   - The second layer color codes each country based on the population of the country  
- Sample datasets are used to display the volcanoes and color code the countries. Different data can be rendered on the map by using a different file and changing the name of the files in the source code in WebMap.py
